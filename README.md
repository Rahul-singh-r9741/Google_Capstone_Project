Capstone project: Providing data-driven suggestions for HR
Description and deliverables
This capstone project is an opportunity for you to analyze a dataset and build predictive models that can provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm.

Upon completion, you will have two artifacts that you would be able to present to future employers. One is a brief one-page summary of this project that you would present to external stakeholders as the data professional in Salifort Motors. The other is a complete code notebook provided here. Please consider your prior course work and select one way to achieve this given project question. Either use a regression model or machine learning model to predict whether or not an employee will leave the company. The exemplar following this actiivty shows both approaches, but you only need to do one.

In your deliverables, you will include the model evaluation (and interpretation if applicable), a data visualization(s) of your choice that is directly related to the question you ask, ethical considerations, and the resources you used to troubleshoot and find answers or solutions.

Pace: Plan
Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Document to reflect on the Plan stage.

In this stage, consider the following:

Understand the business scenario and problem
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. They refer to you as a data analytics professional and ask you to provide data-driven suggestions based on your understanding of the data. They have the following question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company?

Your goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

If you can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.

Familiarize yourself with the HR dataset
The dataset that you'll be using in this lab contains 15,000 rows and 10 columns for the variables listed below.

Note: you don't need to download any data to complete this lab. For more information about the data, refer to its source on Kaggle.

##Reflect on these questions as you complete the plan stage.
1) Who are your stakeholders for this project?
2) What are you trying to solve or accomplish?
3) What are your initial observations when you explore the data?
4) What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage? (Make sure to include the links.)
5) Do you have any ethical considerations in this stage?

##Answers:
1) The stakeholders for this project are the management team from Salifor Motors
2) I'm trying to develope an algorithm that will predict whether an employee will leave or stay with Salifor Motors by looking at importatnt features that could describe employee satisfaction.
3) There seems to be a satisfaction column for employees, however, I would be cautios about this column as this might be biased data, given that employees might not feel comfortable expressing their dissatisfaction to their employer.
4) I will be using the notebooks from the "Go Beyond the Numbers" course and will implement their EDA practices to ensure I have the highest quality data for my model.
5) In order to complete the planning stage I will refer to the final course project of the "Foundations to Data Science" course in order to properly structure my project proposal and define my goals accordingly.
6) This project deals with a very important ethical consideration which is employee livelihood. Because we are creating an algorithm that basically tells the company if this employee is a valuable asset that will stick around and is worth the investment, we must make sure that our training data contains no bias towards a specific type of employees.
